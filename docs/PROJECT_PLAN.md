## Core Architecture

### Smart Extraction Engine
```
URL Input ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Context Files Output
```

**Single Command Interface:**
```bash
# After git clone and npm install
scrape <url>
# Or direct execution
node bin/scrape.js <url>
```

**Output Structure:**
```
scrape-output/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ summary.md          # Executive summary
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.txt         # Full text content, cleaned
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json       # Structured metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context.md          # LLM-optimized context
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ entities.json       # Extracted entities (optional)
```

### Agentic Features
- **Smart Mode by Default**: AI determines extraction strategy automatically
- **Platform Auto-Detection**: Recognizes Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, news sites, etc.
- **Self-Healing**: Adapts when page structures change
- **Anti-Detection**: Human-like behavior simulation, stealth browsing

---

## Phase 2: TypeScript Migration & Architecture Refactor (Next Priority)

### Migration Goals
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Clean Architecture**: SOLID principles and dependency injection
- **Modular Design**: No file over 300 lines, clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Interfaces and mocks for comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public APIs

### Migration Strategy
1. **Week 1**: Core infrastructure and type definitions
   - Create `src/models/` with all TypeScript interfaces
   - Convert utility functions and configuration
   - Set up build pipeline with proper tsconfig.json
   
2. **Week 2**: Service layer conversion
   - Split `ExtractorEngine` into focused modules
   - Type the learning system with proper DTOs
   - Convert stealth and navigation managers
   
3. **Week 3**: Main application refactor
   - Break up `SmartScraper` (currently 456 lines) into:
     - `ScraperCore`: Main orchestration (< 150 lines)
     - `ExtractionService`: Data extraction logic
     - `LearningService`: Pattern learning integration
     - `AnalysisService`: Page analysis logic
   - Type the context generation system
   
4. **Week 4**: Adapters and testing
   - Convert platform adapters with interfaces
   - Add comprehensive type tests
   - Update documentation

### Architecture Improvements
```typescript
// Before: Monolithic class
class SmartScraper {
  constructor(options) {
    this.options = options;
    this.stealth = new StealthManager();
    // ... many dependencies
  }
}

// After: Clean dependency injection
interface ISmartScraper {
  extract(url: string): Promise<ExtractedData>;
}

class SmartScraper implements ISmartScraper {
  constructor(
    private readonly extractor: IExtractorService,
    private readonly learner: ILearningService,
    private readonly navigator: INavigationService,
    private readonly logger: ILogger
  ) {}
}
```

### Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Clear contracts and boundaries
- **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies
- **Scalability**: Add new extractors without modifying core
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support

### Refactoring Priorities (Based on Current File Sizes)
1. **Critical - Over 300 lines**:
   - `src/extractors/engine.js` (750 lines) ‚Üí Split into 4-5 focused extractors
   - `src/context/generator.js` (537 lines) ‚Üí Split into format-specific generators
   - `src/smart.js` (466 lines) ‚Üí Split into core + services
   - `src/stealth/manager.js` (329 lines) ‚Üí Split stealth strategies
   - `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.js` (316 lines) ‚Üí Simplify task management
   - `src/adapters/instagram.js` (306 lines) ‚Üí Extract common patterns

2. **Good Size - Under 300 lines**: 
   - Keep as single modules but add types
   - Focus on interface extraction

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All files under 300 lines
- [ ] 100% TypeScript coverage
- [ ] Zero `any` types
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Full JSDoc documentation
