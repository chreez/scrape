# Scrape - Agentic Web Automation Framework
## Project Plan & Integration with Lore

### Overview
Scrape is an agentic web automation framework designed for intelligent data extraction from any website. It serves as the web scraping engine for the Lore autonomous research system, providing clean, structured context files optimized for LLM consumption.

### Project Status: **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
- **Current Version**: 0.1.0
- **NPX Package**: `@chreez/scrape`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/chreez/scrape
- **Integration Target**: Lore Core Engine (Week 4 - Web Scraper with Playwright)

## Core Architecture

### Smart Extraction Engine
```
URL Input â†’ AI Analysis â†’ Context Files Output
```

**Single Command Interface:**
```bash
# After git clone and npm install
scrape <url>
# Or direct execution
node bin/scrape.js <url>
```

**Output Structure:**
```
scrape-output/
â”œâ”€â”€ summary.md          # Executive summary
â”œâ”€â”€ content.txt         # Full text content, cleaned
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json       # Structured metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ context.md          # LLM-optimized context
â””â”€â”€ entities.json       # Extracted entities (optional)
```

### Agentic Features
- **Smart Mode by Default**: AI determines extraction strategy automatically
- **Platform Auto-Detection**: Recognizes Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, news sites, etc.
- **Self-Healing**: Adapts when page structures change
- **Anti-Detection**: Human-like behavior simulation, stealth browsing
- **Context Optimization**: Formats output for LLM token efficiency

  summary: string;        // Executive summary
  content: string;        // Full cleaned text
  metadata: object;       // Structured data
  context: string;        // LLM-optimized content
  entities?: object[];    // Extracted entities
  // *added from lore* - Database compatibility
  sourceId: string;       // Unique source identifier
  url: string;           // Original URL
  title: string;         // Page/document title
  author?: string;       // Content author
  contentDate?: string;  // Publication date (ISO format)
  scrapedAt: string;     // Extraction timestamp
  confidence: number;    // Extraction confidence (0-1)
