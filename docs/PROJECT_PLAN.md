# Scrape - Agentic Web Automation Framework
## Project Plan & Integration with Lore

### Overview
Scrape is an agentic web automation framework designed for intelligent data extraction from any website. It serves as the web scraping engine for the Lore autonomous research system, providing clean, structured context files optimized for LLM consumption.

### Project Status: **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
- **Current Version**: 0.1.0
- **NPX Package**: `@chreez/scrape`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/chreez/scrape
- **Integration Target**: Lore Core Engine (Week 4 - Web Scraper with Playwright)

## Core Architecture

### Smart Extraction Engine
```
URL Input ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Context Files Output
```

**Single Command Interface:**
```bash
# After git clone and npm install
scrape <url>
# Or direct execution
node bin/scrape.js <url>
```

**Output Structure:**
```
scrape-output/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ summary.md          # Executive summary
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.txt         # Full text content, cleaned
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json       # Structured metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context.md          # LLM-optimized context
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ entities.json       # Extracted entities (optional)
```

### Agentic Features
- **Smart Mode by Default**: AI determines extraction strategy automatically
- **Platform Auto-Detection**: Recognizes Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, news sites, etc.
- **Self-Healing**: Adapts when page structures change
- **Anti-Detection**: Human-like behavior simulation, stealth browsing
- **Context Optimization**: Formats output for LLM token efficiency

## Integration with Lore

### Purpose in Lore Ecosystem
Scrape fulfills **Week 4** requirements from Lore's project plan:
- ‚úÖ Web scraper with Playwright
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Content structure preservation (shallow extraction issues)
- ‚úÖ Paywall detection (via stealth features)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Source verification (basic metadata only)
- ‚ùå PDF extraction (not implemented)
- ‚ùå Rate limiting implementation (not enforced)
- ‚ùå Error handling and retry logic (minimal implementation)

### Current Readiness for Lore: **PARTIALLY READY**
- ‚úÖ Can extract basic content from URLs
- ‚úÖ Creates organized output directories
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Content quality may be insufficient for research needs
- ‚ùå No quality validation or success metrics
- ‚ùå Limited platform coverage for research sources

### Data Flow Integration
```
Lore Research Agent ‚Üí scrape <url> ‚Üí Context Files ‚Üí Lore Processing Pipeline
```

### Output Compatibility
Scrape's context files are designed for direct integration with Lore's:
- Note processing system (Week 5)
- Entity extraction pipeline (Week 5)
- Knowledge graph building (Week 6)
- Export systems (Weeks 9-10)

### API Integration Points
```typescript
// Lore can consume Scrape outputs directly
interface ScrapeOutput {
  summary: string;        // Executive summary
  content: string;        // Full cleaned text
  metadata: object;       // Structured data
  context: string;        // LLM-optimized content
  entities?: object[];    // Extracted entities
  // *added from lore* - Database compatibility
  sourceId: string;       // Unique source identifier
  url: string;           // Original URL
  title: string;         // Page/document title
  author?: string;       // Content author
  contentDate?: string;  // Publication date (ISO format)
  scrapedAt: string;     // Extraction timestamp
  confidence: number;    // Extraction confidence (0-1)
  extractionMethod: string; // Method used for extraction
}
```

## Critical Issues Identified

### Learning System Bug üêõ
**Problem**: Learning system stores and retrieves patterns but doesn't improve extraction quality
- Shows "üß† Using learned extractor sequence" with 100% confidence
- But extraction results remain poor (29 chars from example.com)
- Patterns are cached correctly but not effectively applied
- **Root Cause**: Likely issue in how learned selectors are applied vs default extraction

### Content Extraction Depth Issues üìä
**Problem**: Very shallow content extraction across all sites
- Example.com: Only 29 characters extracted
- Context files show empty or minimal content sections
- Missing full article/page content
- **Impact**: Insufficient for research/LLM consumption needs

### Testing Infrastructure Gap üß™
**Problem**: No validation of extraction quality or success rates
- No automated tests for different content types
- No quality metrics or benchmarks
- Unknown reliability across platforms
- **Risk**: Silent failures and poor results go undetected

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions - UPDATED PRIORITIES
1. **Fix Learning System**: Debug why patterns don't improve extraction quality
2. **Improve Content Extraction**: Get full page content instead of shallow extraction
3. **Add Testing Suite**: Validate extraction quality across website types
4. **Fix Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and proper retry logic
5. **Performance Optimization**: Use TaskOrchestrator for parallel processing
6. **Major Platform Support**: Add YouTube, GitHub, Twitter adapters

### Communication with Lore
